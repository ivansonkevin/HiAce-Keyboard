<h1>HiAce by ivansonkevin</h1>
This keyboard was inspired by the "V4n4g0n" by TheVan Keyboards and aims to be the best keyboard layout for gaming.
The layout used is a slightly modified JetVan Layout; designed due to ivansonkevin's boredom during his semester break. 

<h2>Layout</h2>
This is the current layout of the HiAce.

Conveniently, all keycap sizes in this layout can generally be found in most keycap kits
