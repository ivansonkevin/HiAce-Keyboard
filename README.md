<h1>HiAce by ivansonkevin</h1>
This keyboard was inspired by the "V4n4g0n" by TheVan Keyboards and aims to be the best keyboard layout for gaming.
The layout used is a slightly modified JetVan Layout; designed due to ivansonkevin's boredom during his semester break.

This is the current layout of the HiAce.

Conveniently, all keycap sizes in this layout can generally be found in most keycap kits in the market.
